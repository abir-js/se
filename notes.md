Software engineering is the **systematic, disciplined, and measurable approach** to the **design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems**.

In simpler terms, it‚Äôs the branch of computer science that applies **engineering principles** to create high-quality, reliable, and efficient software that meets user needs.

### Key Points:

* **Engineering discipline** ‚Üí Uses structured methods, tools, and processes rather than ad-hoc coding.
* **Systematic approach** ‚Üí Involves requirements gathering, planning, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.
* **Quality focus** ‚Üí Ensures software is reliable, scalable, secure, and cost-effective.
* **Team collaboration** ‚Üí Often involves multiple developers, testers, designers, and project managers working together.
* **Lifecycle management** ‚Üí Considers the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### Main Goals:

1. Build **correct** software that meets requirements.
2. Ensure **efficiency** and **performance**.
3. Make software **maintainable** and **scalable**.
4. Deliver software **on time** and **within budget**.

üëâ In short: **Programming is about writing code; software engineering is about building software systems successfully.**

# Software models present

---

## 1. **Waterfall Model**

* **Description:** Oldest and simplest model. Development flows **sequentially** like a waterfall: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Coding ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance.
* **Advantages:** Easy to understand, well-structured, good for small projects with clear requirements.
* **Disadvantages:** Rigid, hard to go back to a previous phase, poor for projects with changing requirements.

---

## 2. **Incremental Model**

* **Description:** Software is built in **increments (parts/modules)**. Each increment adds functionality until the final system is complete.
* **Advantages:** Early delivery of working software, easier to test and fix, good for medium/large projects.
* **Disadvantages:** Needs good planning, integration may become complex.

---

## 3. **Spiral Model**

* **Description:** Combines **Waterfall + Iterative + Risk Analysis**. Development happens in cycles (spirals), each with four phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering, and Evaluation.
* **Advantages:** Best for **high-risk projects**, allows risk management, flexible for changes.
* **Disadvantages:** Expensive, requires skilled risk assessment, not suitable for small projects.

---

## 4. **V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)**

* **Description:** Extension of Waterfall. Each development phase (on the left side of the ‚ÄúV‚Äù) is directly linked to a **testing phase** (on the right side). Example: Requirements ‚Üî Acceptance Testing.
* **Advantages:** Strong focus on testing, good for critical systems (e.g., healthcare, defense).
* **Disadvantages:** Rigid like Waterfall, not good for changing requirements.

---

## 5. **Agile Model**

* **Description:** Modern, flexible model. Development is done in **small iterations (sprints)**, delivering working software quickly and adapting to changing requirements.
* **Advantages:** Fast delivery, customer involvement, highly adaptable, continuous improvement.
* **Disadvantages:** Needs experienced team, difficult to estimate cost/time, may lose focus without discipline.

---

## 6. **Iterative Model**

* **Description:** Software is developed in **repeated cycles (iterations)**. Each iteration improves or adds features until the system is complete.
* **Advantages:** Early version of software available, flexible to changes, easier risk handling.
* **Disadvantages:** Requires good planning and design, may need more resources.

---

## 7. **Big Bang Model**

* **Description:** No structured plan. Developers start coding with minimal requirements and adjust as the project grows.
* **Advantages:** Simple, less planning, good for small projects or experiments.
* **Disadvantages:** Very risky, not suitable for large projects, may fail if requirements change.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**

* **Waterfall, V-Model** ‚Üí Best for **fixed requirements**.
* **Incremental, Iterative** ‚Üí Best when requirements may change moderately.
* **Spiral, Agile** ‚Üí Best for **complex, high-risk, or dynamic projects**.
* **Big Bang** ‚Üí Best only for **small/simple projects or prototypes**.

# Software development and requirement analysis in Agile

---

## **1. Software Development (in Agile context)**

Software development is the **process of creating software applications** ‚Äî from idea to deployment and maintenance.

In **Agile**, development happens in **small, iterative cycles** called **sprints** (usually 1‚Äì4 weeks).

* Instead of building the whole system at once (like Waterfall), Agile focuses on **developing working features step by step**.
* Each sprint produces a **working version** of the software (an increment) that can be tested, reviewed, and improved.

**Agile Software Development Principles (from Agile Manifesto):**

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Responding to change over following a strict plan.
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

üëâ **In short**: Software development in Agile = **continuous, adaptive, and incremental building of software** with customer feedback at each stage.

---

## **2. Requirement Analysis in Agile**

Requirement analysis = **understanding, documenting, and prioritizing what the customer actually needs**.

In traditional methods (like Waterfall), requirements are fully documented **before coding starts**.
But in Agile, requirements are handled in a **flexible and ongoing way**:

### How it works in Agile:

1. **User Stories:** Requirements are written as **user stories** in plain language.

   * Example: *‚ÄúAs a student, I want to log in with my fingerprint so that I can mark attendance easily.‚Äù*
2. **Product Backlog:** All user stories are collected in a **backlog** (a to-do list of features).
3. **Prioritization:** The product owner prioritizes backlog items based on business value and customer needs.
4. **Sprint Planning:** At the start of each sprint, the team selects a set of high-priority user stories to implement.
5. **Continuous Feedback:** After each sprint, customers review the software and provide feedback ‚Üí requirements may change ‚Üí backlog is updated.

---

‚úÖ **Key Difference from Traditional Requirement Analysis:**

* **Traditional:** Requirements fixed early, little room for change.
* **Agile:** Requirements evolve continuously, based on customer feedback and market changes.

---

üëâ In summary:

* **Agile Software Development** = Building software in **small increments** with fast delivery.
* **Agile Requirement Analysis** = Collecting, refining, and adjusting requirements **continuously using user stories and backlog management**.

---

# **Scrum Framework**

Scrum is a **lightweight, iterative, and incremental framework** used to manage and develop complex software projects.
It focuses on **small teams**, **short iterations (sprints)**, and **continuous feedback** to deliver working software quickly and adapt to changing requirements.

---

## üîë **Key Elements of Scrum**

### 1. **Roles in Scrum**

Scrum defines 3 main roles:

* **Product Owner** ‚Üí Represents the customer, defines and prioritizes requirements (product backlog).
* **Scrum Master** ‚Üí Ensures Scrum practices are followed, removes obstacles, acts as a coach/facilitator.
* **Development Team** ‚Üí Cross-functional team (designers, developers, testers) who build the product.

---

### 2. **Artifacts in Scrum**

* **Product Backlog** ‚Üí A prioritized list of all features, user stories, and requirements.
* **Sprint Backlog** ‚Üí Subset of items from the product backlog chosen for the current sprint.
* **Increment** ‚Üí A working version of the product delivered at the end of each sprint.

---

### 3. **Events (Ceremonies) in Scrum**

* **Sprint** ‚Üí Fixed time-boxed iteration (usually 1‚Äì4 weeks).
* **Sprint Planning** ‚Üí Meeting where the team decides what to build in the sprint.
* **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)** ‚Üí Short daily meeting (15 min) to sync progress, plans, and blockers.
* **Sprint Review** ‚Üí At the end of sprint, team demonstrates the increment to stakeholders.
* **Sprint Retrospective** ‚Üí Team reflects on the sprint and discusses improvements for the next one.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Scrum Workflow**

1. Product Owner creates and prioritizes the **Product Backlog**.
2. Team selects tasks for the **Sprint Backlog** during Sprint Planning.
3. Development happens during the **Sprint** (with daily stand-ups).
4. At the end ‚Üí **Increment** is delivered.
5. **Review & Retrospective** improve the next cycle.

---

## ‚úÖ **Why Scrum?**

* Delivers working software **faster**.
* Handles **changing requirements** easily.
* Encourages **team collaboration & transparency**.
* Provides **continuous customer feedback**.

---

üëâ **In short:**
**Scrum = Agile in action** ‚Üí A framework that breaks down development into **sprints**, with defined **roles, events, and artifacts**, ensuring continuous improvement and value delivery.

# **Waterfall vs Agile**

| Feature                      | **Waterfall Model**                                                                                  | **Agile Model**                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Approach**                 | Sequential, step-by-step (Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance). | Iterative and incremental, divided into short cycles (sprints).             |
| **Flexibility**              | Very rigid, hard to make changes once a phase is complete.                                           | Highly flexible, requirements can change anytime.                           |
| **Customer Involvement**     | Customer is involved mainly at the start (requirement phase) and end (delivery).                     | Customer is continuously involved after every sprint.                       |
| **Delivery**                 | Final product delivered only at the end of the project.                                              | Working product delivered at the end of each sprint.                        |
| **Project Size Suitability** | Best for small projects with clear, fixed requirements.                                              | Best for medium to large projects with evolving requirements.               |
| **Testing**                  | Testing starts only after development is complete.                                                   | Testing happens continuously in every sprint.                               |
| **Risk Management**          | High risk, as issues are discovered late in the process.                                             | Lower risk, since feedback and testing occur early and often.               |
| **Documentation**            | Heavy documentation before coding starts.                                                            | Minimal documentation, focus on working software.                           |
| **Cost & Time**              | May increase if requirements change (rework needed).                                                 | More cost-effective for changing requirements, but needs disciplined teams. |
| **Team Collaboration**       | Team works in silos, communication is limited.                                                       | Team works collaboratively with daily interactions (stand-ups).             |

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**

* **Waterfall** ‚Üí Best when requirements are fixed, simple, and well-defined.
* **Agile** ‚Üí Best when requirements are uncertain, changing, or the project is complex.

---


# If the **requirements keep changing**, the most **suitable framework** is the **Agile Model** (and within Agile, **Scrum** is the most widely used). ‚úÖ

---

### üîé Why Agile is suitable:

* **Flexibility:** Agile allows requirements to be added, modified, or removed at any stage.
* **Customer feedback:** Continuous involvement of the customer ensures new requirements are understood and prioritized quickly.
* **Short iterations (sprints):** The product is developed in small increments, so changes can be applied in the next sprint without reworking the whole system.
* **Risk reduction:** Frequent delivery and testing reduce the risk of project failure when requirements evolve.

---

### ‚ùå Why not Waterfall?

* In Waterfall, requirements are **locked at the beginning**.
* Any change requires going back to earlier phases (expensive and time-consuming).
* If requirements keep changing, Waterfall projects usually **fail or exceed cost/time limits**.

---

‚úÖ **Answer:**
For scenarios where requirements change frequently, **Agile (Scrum/Kanban)** is the best framework.

# **Crisis on the Horizon**

## üìå Crisis in Software Engineering ("Crisis on the Horizon")

In software engineering, the term **Software Crisis** (sometimes expressed as *‚ÄúCrisis on the Horizon‚Äù*) refers to the serious challenges that arose when software development couldn‚Äôt keep up with growing complexity and demand.

It was first highlighted in the **1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference**, when experts noticed that:

* Projects were **late**.
* Budgets were **exceeded**.
* Software was often **unreliable** or **failed completely**.
* Maintenance was **very costly**.
* Developers lacked structured methods ‚Üí coding was done in an ad-hoc manner.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problems that Caused the Crisis

1. **Growing Complexity** ‚Üí Software systems became larger and harder to manage.
2. **Poor Project Management** ‚Üí No proper planning, scheduling, or monitoring.
3. **Unclear Requirements** ‚Üí Clients kept changing requirements, causing chaos.
4. **Low Reliability** ‚Üí Programs often crashed or had too many bugs.
5. **High Cost & Delays** ‚Üí Projects exceeded deadlines and budgets.
6. **Maintenance Issues** ‚Üí Fixing and updating was more expensive than building.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions (How the Crisis Led to Modern Software Engineering)

To solve the ‚Äúcrisis on the horizon,‚Äù structured approaches were developed:

* **Software Engineering discipline** (treating software development like engineering).
* **Development Models** (Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, etc.).
* **Project management techniques** (Scrum, Kanban, SDLC phases).
* **Standardized tools & methodologies** (CASE tools, testing frameworks, version control).
* **Better quality assurance** (reviews, verification & validation).

---

‚úÖ **In simple words:**
‚Äú**Crisis on the Horizon**‚Äù in software engineering refers to the **software crisis** ‚Äî when the industry realized traditional programming methods couldn‚Äôt handle complex, growing demands, and thus **software engineering** was born to solve it.

---


# **1. Measure (in Software Engineering)**

A **measure** is a **quantitative value** that represents a single attribute of a software product or process.

* It is the **raw data** collected.
* Example: *The program has 500 lines of code (LOC).*

---

# **2. Metric**

A **metric** is a **derived measure** ‚Äî it uses one or more measures to provide meaningful information for decision-making.

* It indicates the **quality, performance, or efficiency** of the software.
* Example: *Defect Density = Number of Defects / LOC.*

---

# ‚úÖ Difference in Simple Words:

* **Measure** = ‚ÄúWhat you count.‚Äù (raw number)
* **Metric** = ‚ÄúWhat that count means.‚Äù (interpreted value)

---

# **3. Examples**

### Example 1:

* **Measure:** 100 defects found during testing.
* **Metric:** Defect density = 100 defects / 10,000 LOC = 0.01 defects per LOC.

### Example 2:

* **Measure:** Project took 400 hours of effort.
* **Metric:** Productivity = LOC / Effort = 20,000 LOC / 400 hours = 50 LOC/hour.

### Example 3:

* **Measure:** 200 requirements documented, 180 implemented.
* **Metric:** Requirement Coverage = (Implemented / Documented) √ó 100 = 90%.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**

* **Measure** = Raw data (lines of code, number of errors, hours worked).
* **Metric** = Analyzed value (defect density, productivity, coverage) used to improve quality and management.

---


## üéØ **Objectives of Priority Planning**

1. **Efficient Resource Utilization**

   * Ensure that time, money, and human effort are used on the most important tasks first.

2. **Meeting Deadlines**

   * Helps the team focus on high-priority tasks to deliver the project on schedule.

3. **Maximizing Business Value**

   * Prioritize features/requirements that bring the highest value to the customer or organization.

4. **Managing Risks**

   * Address high-risk items early to avoid bigger problems later in the project.

5. **Improving Decision-Making**

   * Provides a structured way to decide what to do now, what to postpone, and what to ignore.

6. **Handling Changing Requirements**

   * In dynamic environments (like Agile), priority planning ensures adaptability by re-ranking tasks as per new needs.

7. **Customer Satisfaction**

   * By delivering the most important features first, customers see value earlier and trust the process.

8. **Avoiding Work Overload**

   * Prevents the team from wasting time on less critical tasks when urgent work is pending.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
The objective of priority planning is to **deliver maximum value, minimize risks, and ensure efficient use of resources by focusing on the most important tasks first**.

---

Do you want me to also show you **methods used in priority planning** (like MoSCoW, Kano model, or risk-value matrix)?
